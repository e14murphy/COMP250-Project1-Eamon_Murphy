To use this program, first run setGenerator.java
It will ask you for a number of hexagon angle sets to generate, and a filename for the file where they will be stored. These files are stored in the data_files directory.
Then, run hexagonFinder.java, and input the filename of the data file. You do not need to include the ".csv" file extension.
The validity of every set in a file will be printed in the terminal.
